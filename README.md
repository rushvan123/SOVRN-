                SOVRN CRYPTOCURRENCY 



A Quantum-Secure, BRICS-Aligned Decentralized Exchange for Sovereign Wealth Tokens and Asset-Backed CryptocurrenciesOverviewSOVRN is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) built on Arbitrum, designed to empower BRICS nations and institutional investors with a secure, transparent, and scalable platform for trading tokenized sovereign wealth assets, metals (e.g., gold), petroleum, rare earths, land, agricultural assets, and the BRICS UNIT stablecoin. Leveraging Chainlink VRF for randomness, quantum-resistant cryptography, and cross-border payment integration (SWIFT, MBRIDGE, CIPS), SOVRN aims to redefine DeFi by bridging real-world assets with blockchain technology.Key Features

Tokenized Assets: Trade sovereign wealth tokens (SWTs), tokenized gold, oil, rare earths, land, and agricultural assets with verified custody (e.g., Fortress Trust).

BRICS UNIT Stablecoin: A pegged stablecoin backed by a basket of BRICS currencies (35% CNY, 20% INR, 15% RUB, 10% BRL, 5% ZAR, 10% gold, 5% oil) for stability and global trade.

Quantum-Secure Infrastructure: Built with quantum-resistant cryptography and Chainlink VRF for transparent governance and minting.

Cross-Border Payments: Supports settlements via SWIFT, MBRIDGE, CIPS, UPI, PIX, and SPFS for seamless global transactions.

Governance: Decentralized governance with VRF-based randomness, requiring 10,000 SOVRN tokens to propose changes.

Modular GKR Protocol: Optional integration of the GKR (Goldwasser-Kalai-Rothblum) protocol for verifiable computation of SWT valuations and governance processes.

NFT Support: Limited support for tokenized land and cultural NFTs, aligning with BRICSâ€™ resource and cultural priorities.
